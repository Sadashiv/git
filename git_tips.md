Git Tips and tricks
===================

Get a latest commit from branch
---------------------------------
cat .git/refs/heads/git
be98beb57eed7e842dbbcc19afc1a340dc7a2f61
or
git rev-parse gitolite (gitolite is branch)
be98beb57eed7e842dbbcc19afc1a340dc7a2f61

git revert and git rebase 
-------------------------
git revert commitid -> Removes the data associated with commit and creates new commitid2
Again you want to bring changes back use commitid git cherry-pick commitid or git revert commitid2


git checkout master -- linux/* #checkout the sinle file of multiple file from master branch
git diff master test path_to_file_or_folder > diff.txt #Diff between two branches

The lesson here is that if youâ€™re going to push changes, make a bare repository clone with git clone --bare.

git add -p
git branch -r -d <remote-branch> #remove the remote branch
git stash drop [<stash-name>] --> delete the stash


Delete all the local tag:<br/>
$ git tag -l | xargs git tag -d<br/>
Delete all the Remote tag:<br/>
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin<br/>

git pull and rebase
